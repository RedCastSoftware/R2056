A simple 6502 emulator that looks like it was written in a basement
I made this as a base for anyone who needs something simple that works or as a base for a more complex emulator like a NES. I currently have python and javascript versions available but may add C# and others soon.
Note: So far, only a few instructions have been added but will add more in the future.
