# R2056
A simple 6502 emulator that looks like it was written in a basement
I made this as a base for anyone who needs something simple that works or as a base for a more complex emulator like a NES. This emulator is currently being fixed due to speed, and structuring issues. A version written in c will be out shortly.
Note: So far, only a few instructions have been added but will add more in the future.

Requirements (Python):
-standard python libraries (time)
-numpy

Requirements (Javascript):
-Node.js (As new as possible)
-Node standard functions
